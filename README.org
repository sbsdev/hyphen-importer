#+TITLE: Hyphenation Importer

A quick hack to import a set of hyphenations from a csv file and
generate sql that can be inserted into the existing database.

The approach ultimately failed due to [[https://medium.com/@manish_demblani/breaking-out-from-the-mysql-character-set-hell-24c6a306e1e5][MySQL collation problems]] (aka is
a string equal to another string under which collation?).

The repo is kept around to serve as an example on how to write a
script using the [[https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli][Clojure CLI tools]]. Also there is a handy [[file:bin/cider][script to
start a REPL server]]. The original implementation is from [[https://lambdaisland.com/][Arne Brasseur]]
in a repo called [[https://github.com/plexus/tablizer][tablizer]] and is described in an [[https://clojureverse.org/t/tablizer-fun-experiment-with-clojure-cli-tools/1249][article]] on
[[https://clojureverse.org][clojureverse]].

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
clj -m hyphen-import hyph-de-new.csv > import.sql
#+END_SRC

* REPL

Connect to a REPL via cider by starting the script in the bin
directory.

* Prerequisites

Install the Clojure cli tools as described in the [[https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started][Getting Started
Guide]].
